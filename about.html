            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Gerardo ramirez. I am currently an aspiring software engineer at Coding Temple.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I've been passionate about baseball my entire life, playing the sport from a young age all the way through high school. Despite dealing with weight problems over the years, I was able to overcome those challenges and lost an impressive 90 pounds. Dedication and hard work have always been a big part of who I am.
               Academics were also a priority for me, and I graduated high school with an outstanding 4.2 GPA. Maintaining that level of academic excellence while also pursuing my athletic interests was not always easy, but I was driven to excel in all areas of my life.
               The journey hasn't always been smooth, but the experiences I've had have shaped me into the person I am today - someone who is determined, disciplined, and committed to reaching their goals, no matter the obstacle. I'm excited to continue growing and pushing myself to new heights in the next chapter of my life.</p>
